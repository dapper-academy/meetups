# Dapper Academy

Learn cutting-edge dApp and smart contract development on the Ethereum blockchain! No experience necessary - we're holding free introductory workshops on building dApps with Solidity smart contracts. Bring your machine and get ready to #BUIDL.

## What we're about

Dapper Academy is a meetup group for dApp developers and decentralized technologists. The goal of this meetup is to foster a community and an ecosystem for individuals working on dApp development, token models, protocols, cryptoeconomics, mechanism design, game theory, radical markets, cryptography, security, and related topics. It provides an opportunity to collaborate, deep-dive, and contribute to the ever-growing Token Engineering and dApp development knowledge base.

This community is for anyone looking to explore and expand their knowledge in new areas of decentralized technology. Speakers of all levels are welcome to share a talk on a technical topic of their interest! This means presenting a paper, study, theory, concept, framework, or protocol that they are working on and discussing their design, challenges, and lessons learned. Ideas we especially would like to hear about include Curation Markets, Token Curated Registries, Bonding Curves, decentralized finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens, ERC proposals, meta transactions, smart contract security and related topics.

Come and join us! Together we can establish the building blocks of a new cooperative framework for humanity using decentralized technologies.

## What we're not about

Dapper Academy is a learning circle for an audience of developers and researchers. This meetup is NOT is a place for promoting ICOs, cryptocurrency investment tactics, or business pitches.
