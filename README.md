# Dapper Academy

Dapper Academy aims to foster a community and ecosystem for individuals working with decentralized technologies. Our events provides an opportunity to collaborate, deep-dive, and contribute to the emerging field of decentralized systems engineering. [Check out our meetup schedule](https://www.meetup.com/Dapper-Academy/).

At our events we discuss dApp development, token engineering, protocol design, cryptoeconomics, mechanism design, game theory, radical markets, cryptography, security, and other related topics.

## Who this group is for

Dapper Academy is for developers and researchers looking to explore and expand their knowledge in new areas of decentralized technology. 

#### For Attendees

Learn cutting-edge dApp and smart contract development on the Ethereum blockchain! No experience necessary - we hold free introductory workshops on how to build dApps and write Solidity smart contracts. 
Just bring your machine and get ready to **#BUIDL**!

#### For Speakers

Speakers of all levels are welcome to share a talk on a technical topic of their interest. This means presenting a paper, study, theory, concept, framework, or protocol that they are working on and discussing their design, challenges, and lessons learned. 

We especially would like to hear about Curation Markets, Token Curated Registries, Bonding Curves, decentralized finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens, ERC proposals, meta transactions, smart contract security and related topics.
